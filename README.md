To give a more detailed explanation with a screenshot, I'll provide an explanation for the "Work" section, specifically focusing on the Bootstrap cards:

### Work
The "Work" section of the website showcases Victor's work experience using Bootstrap cards. Here's a breakdown of the code and a screenshot:

```html
<div id="work">
  <div class="cardContainer col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6">
    <h1> My Work Experience</h1>
    <div class="card-row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <div class="card">
          <div class="cardContainer col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6"></div>
          <h5 class="card-title">My Portfolio</h5>
          <img class="card-img-top" src="./images/logo.png" alt="Card image cap">
          <p class="card-text">Check it out!!</p>
          <a href="https://github.com/KevinDsouza7/Bootstrap-Portfolio" class="btn btn-primary">Source Code</a>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="cardContainer col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6">
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-row">
            <h5 class="card-title">Next Project</h5>
            <img class="card-img-top" src="./images/logo.png" alt="logo">
            <p class="card-text">TBD</p>
            <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Unavailable</a>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

In this code, Bootstrap cards are used to present work experience. Each card contains the following elements:

- `card-title`: Displays the project title, e.g., "My Portfolio."
- `card-img-top`: Displays an image related to the project.
- `card-text`: Provides a brief description of the project.
- `btn btn-primary`: Offers a button to link to the source code on GitHub.

The "Work" section can be customized to showcase additional projects by replicating the card structure and providing details for each project.

Please replace [Insert screenshot of the "Work" section here] with an actual screenshot of the "Work" section from your website to complete your README.
